  Hello guys, my name is Pedro, im currently living in Curitiba, State of Parana, Brazil. Im 24yo, studying analysis and systems development at Pontifica Universade Católica do Paraná.

  At the moment im not focusing on anything specific in relation to programming, just studying Python, because its a relatively simple and easy language as a learning base. 

  Im currently in the first semester of the course, looking for an internship to be able to put my studies into practice and continue developing myself as a programmer and student.

  You can reach me by adding in discord: peedroo1 (the one with a weird picture lol), steam account: https://steamcommunity.com/id/peedrooca1/ or instagram: @pedroavdl.

	Fun fact: When I was in the army, in 2018, the captain said I couldnt stay more than a year because they didnt want someone too dumb or too smart (I hope Im the smart one);
